<h3>bmc_simulate - Generates a trace of the model from 0 (zero) to k</h3>
<hr>
<code>bmc_simulate [-h | [-p | -v] -k <length>]</code><p>
bmc_simulate does not require a specification 
  to build the problem, because only the model is used to build it. 
  The problem length is represented by the <i>-k</i> command parameter, 
  or by its default value stored in the environment variable 
  <i>bmc_length</i>.<BR>
  Command options:<p>
  <dl>
    <dt> <tt>-p <i>prints out the generated trace, with only variables whose  
     values had changed</i>.</tt> <BR>
    <dt> <tt>-v <i>prints out the generated trace</i>.</tt> <BR>
    <dt> <tt>-k <i>length</i></tt>
       <dd> <i>length</i> is the length of the generated simulation. <BR>
  </dl>
