<h3>compute_reachable - Enables the future computation of the set of reachable states</h3>
<hr>
<code>compute_reachable [-h]</code><p>
Sets a flag in the system that triggers the lazy 
  calculation of the set of reachable states every time it is needed. 

  The set of reachable states is used to simplify image and
  preimage computations. This can result in improved performances for
  models with sparse state spaces. Sometimes this option may slow down
  the performances because the computation of reachable states may be
  very expensive. The environment variable <tt>forward_search</tt> is
  set after the execution of this command.
